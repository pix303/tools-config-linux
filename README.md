# .config folder for linux

Tools used in linux distro in wsl2 managed by Mise En Place

For install LSPs for html, js, ts, css, json don't use Mise En Place but pnpm with this package 
`pnpm i -g vscode-langservers-extracted`

It's better for Mise En Place first installation to avoid its infinite loop if using `npm:name-of-package`, and it's better for Helix that immediately find LSPs.
