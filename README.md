# .config folder for linux

Tools used in linux distro in wsl2 managed by Mise En Place

For lsp for html, js, ts, css, json use 
`pnpm i -g vscode-langservers-extracted`

Better for first install with Mise to avoid infinite loop and crash if using npm:name-of-package, and better for helix that immidiatly find lsps.
