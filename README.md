# .config folder for linux

Tools used in linux distro in wsl2 managed by Mise En Place

For lsp for html, js, ts, css, json use 
`pnpm i -g vscode-langservers-extracted`

Better for Mise En Place first installation to avoid its infinite loop if using `npm:name-of-package`, and better for Helix that immediately find LSPs.
